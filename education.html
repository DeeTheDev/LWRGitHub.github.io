            <li id="liEd">I have sharpened my skills significantly though many online courses. This happened because I am a very dedicated person who has spent many days getting up in the morning going down to the coffee shop and staying their studying programing until it closes. </li>
            <li id="liEd">I have also done great in my Python, C# & React.js Classes. I took classes at Noisebridge in Python & C#. The C# Class gave me good knowledge of the game engine Unity.</li>
