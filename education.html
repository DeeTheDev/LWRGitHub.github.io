        	<li>Top student in the Code Tenderloin JavaScript class. This was a two part program about one month for both. Completing the intro to JavaScript, then moving to Javascript advanced. I did so well I got to skip the begining of the second class & move right into the middle of it.</li>
            <li>Code Tenderloin recommended me to several schools and tech companies.</li>
            <li>I got accepted into a very competitive six month online Ruby class That I am currently taking. This class comes with a posible inturnship at the end of it.</li>
            <li>I have sharpened my skills significantly though many online courses.</li>
